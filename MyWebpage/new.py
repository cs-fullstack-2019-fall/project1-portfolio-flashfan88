# Exercise 1:
# Create a program that takes user input. Print Loop. Nothing is done with the user input yet.

# input1 = input("Insert input here")
# print("Loop")

# Exercise 2:
# Create a program that takes user input and prints the user input.

# input1 = input("type here")
# print(input1)

# number = 5
# while number >= 0:
#     print(number)
#     number -= 0

# myvar = ''
# while myvar != 'x':
#     myvar = input('Input Here')
#     print(myvar)

# Exercise 3:
# Create a program that takes user input in a while loop.
# If they enter ‘q’ or 0 (your choice), quit. Inside the loop print LOOP

# myvar1 = ''
# while myvar1 != 'q' or 0:
#     myvar1 = input('Insert here')
#     print("LOOP")

# Exercise 4:
# Create a program that uses a Python range to loop from 50 to 10 and print each number in the console.

# for n in range(50, 9, -1):
#     print(n)

# Exercise 5:
# Create a program that will count down from 10 to 1
# (print the number) then print LIFTOFF! in the console

number = 10
while number >= 1:
     print(number)
     number = number -1

print("LIFTOFF!")


# Exercise 6:
# Create a program that prompts for the starting and ending number for a counting loop.
# In the loop, count from the start number to end number entered by 5s.
# Print each number in the console.
